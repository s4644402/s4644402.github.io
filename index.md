### Hey! Welcome to my Blog!

My name is Aswin Jacob Lijo (Student Number: 45304651) and I am 4th Year Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Student at The University of Queensland. I have really enjoyed the ELEC4630 course so far, as it has definely expanded my knowledge in the field of Image Processing and I look forward to venturing into the Deep Learning aspects. Through this blog I want to document my learning on FastAI, and recount my journey into Assignment 2. 

So, Welcome to my Blog!
